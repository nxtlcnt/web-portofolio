          GREAT (Graduate Research on Earthquake and Active Tectonics) is a
          non-profit research organization funded by the World Bank, focusing on
          deformation and earthquake disaster research.

          In this project, GREAT collected the types of school and
          government-owned hospital buildings in Eastern Indonesia based on
          their taxonomy, resistance, material types, and structural features.
          This aims to estimate potential losses due to disasters in each
          region.

          My responsibility area is Southeast Sulawesi (Kendari, Bombana,
          Wakatobi, and East Kolaka), West Sulawesi (Polewali Mandar), and Bali
          (Buleleng and Karangasem). I collected approximately 5,000 samples. In
          the implementation, we used a statistical approach based on the Human
          Development Index before sampling. I developed a scraper using Python
          and Selenium to gather the names of schools and hospitals, along with
          their coordinates and addresses. Afterward, I visualized the map to
          identify the most dominant building taxonomy types in those areas.

          As a Product Manager, we received training on the software development
          life cycle. Following this, our team was given the opportunity to
          create our own web GIS product. Our team&apos;s project, MESH, is a
          web GIS that displays a heatmap and the distribution of 285 points
          based on Landsat imagery from the past five years in the Jababeka area
          of Bekasi Regency. In this project, I was responsible as a full stack
          developer using Next.Js, Supabase, and Map
